This is an in-progress collection of hints for writing and typesetting in the [HExSA][hexsa] research group.
The source is [on GitHub][gh], so you can contribute or fork your own style guide there. This was originally
forked from the excellent style guide from the [Capra][capra] group at Cornell, which you can find the original
code for [here][ghc].

For more good advice, see [Eddie Kohler][ek]’s [LaTeX usage notes][eklatex] or [Claire Le Goues][clg]’s [things she repeats about writing][clgwriting].
