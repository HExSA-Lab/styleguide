Avoid subjective language as much as possible. The phrase *we observe
huge speedups* does not belong in a technical paper. *We demonstrate
a 20Ã— speedup over the baseline* is better. A corollary of this 
is the use of Weasel Words, which are well explained by [Matt Might][mm].

If you've used a paper repo with me, you will see a file called `weasel` which
detects such words in your TeX.
