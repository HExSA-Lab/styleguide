Avoid the [passive voice][pv] as much as reasonable.
When you say *the data is converted*, for example, your writing will be clearer if it is more specific about who or what does the conversion: the system, the algorithm, the user, the server, the authors, etc.

An imperfect way to tell whether a sentence is in the passive voice is to try adding *…by space aliens* to the end.
If that works, you probably want to add a subject for your verb.
(Credit to [Melissa O’Neill][melissa] for this trick.)

Sometimes, rewriting a sentence to avoid the passive voice makes it worse.
Give it an earnest try, but give up if the alternative seems bad.

If I've set up a paper repo for you, you've probably seen a file named `passive`. This
is a perl script I stole from [Matt Might][mm] long ago that detects passive voice in your
TeX and alerts you to it if you want to go hunting. I'd avoid doing that one when you've
only got hours to go before a submission though.
